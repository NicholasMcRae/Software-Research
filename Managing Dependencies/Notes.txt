	Use Best Practices
	Dependency management is a continuous maintenance process with constant room for improvement. Embrace the best practices when managing dependencies:

	Review regularly. Perform periodic reviews of existing dependencies to ensure no unnecessary, outdated, or vulnerable components are present.
	Maintain security. When picking out dependencies, choose those that are actively maintained and have a strong security record.
	Keep it minimal. Using fewer dependencies also means fewer security risks and simpler code. Use only essential dependencies.
	Uphold documentation. Update documentation regularly with the current dependency information. Keep track of names, versions, and sources to simplify collaboration and project details.
	Integrate with CI/CD. Add dependency management to the CI/CD pipeline to automate these tasks efficiently and securely.
