General principles

- The phrase "iterative software development" suffers from the same drawback as "evidence-based medicine" in that it suggests there may be rational alternatives

To quote the late Stefan Tilkov:

"Architecture is a property of a system, not a description of its intended design."

If your development process is focused on discussing and passing around descriptions of the thing you want to build, but you're not actually building, 
testing and learning from it, then rather than being focused on architecture, your process is studiously (and bureaucratically) avoiding it.
