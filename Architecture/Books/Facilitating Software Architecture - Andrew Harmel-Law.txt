Notes
*****
- Traditional hierarchical architects present problems when all decisions have to go through them
	- This slows down the decision making process
	- More code is sitting unreleased, not providing value
- There are centralized and decentralized processes, authoritarian and democratic
	- All have pros and cons
- The architecture advice process is a best of both worlds
	- It is decentralized but also fast
- The architectural advice process:
	- Decision maker needs to consult the following before they make a decision
		- Everyone affected by decision
		- All experts on the decision
- Having trust is key
- delineate between advice and opinion, opinion is the enemy of advice

Rolling out the process
- from the standpoint of a developer with no deciding power:
	- allows architects to be everywhere at once, surfacing the key decisions at hand, without losing accountability
