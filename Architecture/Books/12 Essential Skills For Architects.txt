- Transparency
    - The things that you and others fail to disclose are potential landmines for a project's ability to succeed, they will erode trust
    - Transparency is a key soft skill
    - As an architect your weaknesses and strengths become visible
    - Guidelines
        - How to represent information
        - Identify outstanding issues
        - Identify assumptions
        - Validate the direction with others
        - Think through how you can solve the problem
        - Estimate the size of the problem
        - Estimate how much hardware is needed
        - Determine which groups need to be involved
        - Understand the concerns of each group
        - Capture concerns where you might not have a solution
        - Document your reasons, decisions, alternatives, and issues behind key decisions
    - Issues, assumptions etc are ok, the key is to bring clarity
    - Bring clarity through transparency, not just for you but for others
    - They may have the solution to a particular issue
    - Transparency typs
        - Self transparency
        - Project transparency
        - Relationship transparency
            - Giving credit, same message, apologizing, listening, hear before reacting. Goal is to enhance trust
     - Consistency
        - what you say and how you say it, email, presentations, documents should all be consistent
        - avoid the flippant or funny remark you are dying to make
     - If what you say isn't consistent you'll introduce issues that you will need to deal with in the future
    - Apologizing demonstrates transparency
    - Learn to hear before you react

- Passion
    - Your passion, the source of ideas wanes as the organization moves at a glacial pace
    - Hard to rekindle passion, need to recognize signs that flame is dimming
    - Passion and consistency are a good combination
    - Passion over position, don't take positions you don't care about
    - Find something that helps you get up in the morning
    - Rekindling passion - sometimes just getting away for a few days can help
    - Lack of passion acts as a ceiling to your career

- Context Switching
    - Department focused to business unit or even cross business unit focused
    - From technical structure focused to being heavily business focused

        - Seek proper coupling and cohesion
            - Adding 'just one more thing' introduces entropy, the cohesion of the component becomes less clear
            - as you approve these changes you need to keep in mind the context of the purpose
     - who has the best background to implement functionality, who is going to care if it breaks
     - who understands the nature of the problem from a domain perspective
     - who understands the nonfunctional requirements that need to be implemented?
     - who has a relationship with the customers
     - Elephant context
