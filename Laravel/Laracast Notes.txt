At a glance
***********
- what happens when a request comes in 
- when a person visits the url - before page is rendered, we hit server
- application notices request for home page
- in Laravel we associate URI with a response
- we load controller - receives request - provides response
- controller can generate response in many ways
- Once controller has delegated to the model, it loads the view
- the view receives the data from the controller, and renders it to the user

Routing **
**********

Basic Routing and Views
- laravel welcome screen
- under routes folder
- when user makes get request - in reponse we're loading a view
- view is html part of code base
- views are stored in resource directory
- duplicating routes - registering a new one
	- if user hits welcome, we'll do the same thing
- can return a simple string
- can even return JSON
- JSON will become useful when you start building APIs
- blade is a templating engine for laravel
- get - loading in a browser

Pass Request Data to Views
- sometimes you'll pass data through the query string
- can get this data using request helper function, providing key
- can return string
- can go into test view and echo name - view needs to receive data
- do this in routes file in view 
- however, we're echoing whatever user does, which is dangerous
- so let's escape the input
- you might use htmlspecialchars
	- however in laravel you can surround variable in curly braces
	- whenever referencing variables will use blade
- php doesn't understand this, it has to be compiled, laravel does this
- boils down to htmlspecialchars
- laravel provides a convenient way of doing this
- curly brace with exclamation doesn't escape - for example if you're fetching html

Route Wildcards
- often you'll need routes that accepts a wildcard
- sometimes part of route needs to be unique - post in curly braces
- return a view called posts
- how do we grab that value? might need to fetch it to perform database query
- haven't yet reviewed databases
- can echo post itself
- passed in array, and querying for elements of array
- can show 404 page if array element doesn't exist
- summary
	- updated route for wildcard
	- make it available on clojure
	- simulated database
